# grant_doctor_mapping

The missing dates within the grant data can be replaced with the median values calculated because the range (outliers) were too large for the mean, and the mode did not occur often enough (21%). Filled with median time between the project start and the budget start and then median time between award notice and budget start, but did not reduce NaNs.
